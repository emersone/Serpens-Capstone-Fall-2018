Serpens Web 3 Capstone project

This is a database-backed website where authorized users can give other employees of their company employee recognition awards. The awards are then emailed in PDF format to recipients. There are two types of users: Users and Administrators.

I wrote all code for the user type Administrators, and the BI report creating feature. Admins can view, edit, delete, and add new users and administrators, as well as view relevant BI reports. I also wrote relevant Postman tests to ensure the API was working as expected.

I used Node.js for server-side code, Javascript (Vue.js), HTML, and CSS, as well as Charts.js for front-end. I also wrote Administrator MySQL queries, and finished up UI with Bootstrap.
